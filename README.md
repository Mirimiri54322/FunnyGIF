# FunnyGIF
 Put a funny GIF in your terminal.

## Usage
Run funnygif with the filename of a GIF, and optionally, arguments. For example, "funnygif wizard.gif speed=1.5"
On Linux, you can copy the file "funnygif" into your /usr/local/bin folder, and chaneg the file path to the place where funnygif.py is located to call it from anywhere with just "funnygif".

## Arguments
Each argument is shown with its name and its default value, and a description of what it does.
- colors (colors= however many colors the image has by default) Limits the maximum number of colors to the specified value. Setting this to more colors than the image has will not produce a visible result.
- speed (speed=1.0) A higher speed makes the GIF animate faster, and a lower speed makes it slower.
